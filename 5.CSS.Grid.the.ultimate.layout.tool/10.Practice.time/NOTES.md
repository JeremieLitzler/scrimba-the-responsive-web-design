# Notes

## `min-content` and `max-content`

- the value `min-content` on `grid-template-columns` shrinks the grid cells to their smallest content (e.g. a word for ex).
- the value `max-content` on `grid-template-columns` sets the grid cells to their biggest content (e.g. a sentence for ex).

Check you the `.article-info` on the practice stylesheet.

## `align-self` in a grid

If you have cells on a same row that are of different font sizes and don't vertically, it is the one time you can use `align-self: baseline` :)
