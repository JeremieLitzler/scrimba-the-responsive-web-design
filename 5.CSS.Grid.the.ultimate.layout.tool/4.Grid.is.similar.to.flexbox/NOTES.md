# Notes

**Important note:** try to never set a height on rows but instead use the content to define the height.

By default, grid items stretch!

The properties `align-items`, `justify-items` and `align-self` in Grid work very much like `align-items`, `justify-content` and `align-self`in Flexbox.

See [demo](index.html).
