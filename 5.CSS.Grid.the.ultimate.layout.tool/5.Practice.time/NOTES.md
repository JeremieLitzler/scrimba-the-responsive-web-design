# Notes

Our content is composed of these blocks:

![blocks in design](myself/img/Image-009.png)

But the bottom content cannot be 2 columns while the rest remains on 1 colum.

So let's apply grid!

So we have:

- for small screens:
  - 4 rows
  - 2 columns
- for larger screens:
  - 3 rows
  - 3 columns
