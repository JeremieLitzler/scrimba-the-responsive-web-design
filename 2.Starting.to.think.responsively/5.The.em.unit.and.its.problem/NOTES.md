# Notes

- The `em` x % of the parent element.
  - Ex: 1em = 100%
- Using a relative is very handy because you define the font-size in `px` only in the body and then you use `em` across all selectors.
  - It means that if you change the body font-size, all the elements will relatively be resized :)
- However, using `em` can lead to a cascading a effect where the values can compound.
