# Notes

When `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap`:

- `align-items` works on an individual row of content.
- `align-content` works on all the content of the flex container, **only when there is multiple rows of content**.
- also `align-content` works on the cross axis whereas `justify-content` works on the main axis.
