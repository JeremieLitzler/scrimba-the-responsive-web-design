# Notes

- When do I need to use `background-image` property?
  - Ask those questions:
    - Do I have something over the images ?
      - YES : use the property.
      - NO : use `<img>` element.
- `background-image` **MUST NEVER** be used for content. **It is only for decoration**.
- Some tiny images that can be repeated: [click this link](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/).
- Keep your background images in the a sub directory where the styles are stored.
