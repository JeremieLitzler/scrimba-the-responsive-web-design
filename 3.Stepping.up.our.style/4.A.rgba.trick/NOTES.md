# Notes

- Using `rgba()` function, we can just have the text color to be dark (meaning black) or light (meaning white) and use the alpha parameter to use transparency to get a text color that's in the same tone of the background.

Ex:

```css
footer {
  background: #143774;
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);
}
```
