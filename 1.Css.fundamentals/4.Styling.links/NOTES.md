# Notes

- Pseudo class
  - `a:link` (same as `a`)
  - `a:visited`
  - `a:focus`
  - `a:hover`
  - `a:active`
- **the order above matter!**. That's the fundamental of CSS about priority in the stylesheet.
- styling links is important to let know the user the interactions.
- leave `text-decoration` or replace it with something that is obvious.
